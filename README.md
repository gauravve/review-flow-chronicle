## GitHub Token Permissions

To access private repositories and get full functionality, you'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token with specific permissions.

### Creating a Fine-Grained Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Fine-grained tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Select the repositories you want to access
4. Configure the following permissions:

### Required Permissions

#### Core Features (Pull Requests & Repository Data)
- **Contents** (Read) - Access repository files and basic information
- **Metadata** (Read) - Access basic repository metadata
- **Pull requests** (Read) - View PRs, reviews, comments, and timelines

#### Build Metrics
- **Actions** (Read) - View workflow runs and build history

#### Enhanced Features (Optional but Recommended)
- **Issues** (Read) - Enhanced PR context and linked issues
- **Checks** (Read) - Detailed build status information
- **Commit statuses** (Read) - Legacy build status support

### Alternative: Classic Personal Access Token

If using a classic token, you need:
- **repo** scope (full repository access)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Classic tokens provide broader access than fine-grained tokens but are less secure.

### Token Usage

1. Generate your token with the required permissions
2. Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again)
3. In the application:
   - Enter your repository in the format `owner/repo`
   - Paste your token in the "GitHub Token" field
   - Check "Remember token" to save it in your browser for future use

## Features by Permission

| Feature | Required Permissions | Description |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Public Repository Browsing | None | View PRs and metrics for public repos |
| Private Repository Access | Contents, Metadata, Pull requests | Access private repo data |
| Build Metrics | Actions | View CI/CD pipeline performance |
| Enhanced Build Status | Checks, Commit statuses | Detailed build information |
| Issue Context | Issues | See linked issues in PR timelines |

## Security Notes

- üîê Tokens are stored locally in your browser only
- üö´ No tokens are sent to external servers
- üéØ Fine-grained tokens limit access to specific repositories
- ‚ö° You can revoke tokens anytime in GitHub settings

## Getting Started

1. **For Public Repositories**: No token needed - just enter `owner/repo`
2. **For Private Repositories**: 
   - Create a fine-grained token with the permissions above
   - Enter your repository and token
   - Start exploring your PR metrics!

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" errors
- Verify your token has the required permissions
- Check that the token has access to the specific repository
- Ensure the repository name is spelled correctly

### "Repository not found" errors
- Repository might be private (add a token)
- Check the repository name format: `owner/repo`
- Verify the repository exists and you have access

### Missing build metrics
- Ensure your token has "Actions" read permissions
- Repository must have GitHub Actions workflows
- Workflows must have run within the selected time period

## Development

This project is built with:
- React + TypeScript
- Vite for development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- GitHub REST API
